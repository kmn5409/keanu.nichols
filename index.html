		<h2 id="p10">So I didn't post in a month, yeah I know I'm slacking but since I started working it definitely has been a roller coaster lol, 
		definitely has been eye opening	working somewhere though. I mean DO NOT get me wrong lol I have worked before at the dining commons and Penn State 
		but this is like a full job. I remember my first week of working at NGC when every time I got home I kid you not I would drop down on the couch 
		and just drop asleep. But overtime I'm getting accustomed to it you know and I'm learning a lot, it isn't hard-core programming but you know you 
		have to work with what you got. Also Spiderman Homecoming is coming out soon and I'm going to see it but I don't know how it's going to be but hopefully it's good.

        <h2 id="p9">I know I haven't posted in a while and I apologize <span>lol</span> I'll blame it on Kieran and Kyle for having all these crazy plans consecutively but I have to say it was fun to be out the house and just being around people. I definitely am happy that I'm back home and appreciate it much more now, I know I have <span>lottts</span>  of challenges ahead of me but I feel like I have a chance. It definitely helps to know that I'm starting to patch things up with special people around me and I know I have a lot more work to do with it but I know that it's possible and is definitely worth fighting for. And no matter what has happened in the past you don't have to be defined by your past but what you yourself want to make of the future. </h2>

Also just have to thank all my friends that came out on Saturday it really felt like a welcome back and I have to give a special thank you to Ishala for organizing all of this.</h2>
