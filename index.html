                <h2 id="p11">Well what can I say, I like to think I was busy lol. I mean I have been working a good bit on this 
                    app for this competition Telios Code Jam. It was a lot of work you don't even know lol. I spent weeks 
                    working on this app and sometimes I would wake up a day and literally just work on the app for the whole day.
                    It was a lot of work definitely and I wanted to throw out my computer a few times lol but I have to say it 
                    was definitely worth it. I learnt a good bit from it and I'm proud that I did it, I don't know if we will
                     place but I know for sure I'm proud of what I did. Also having been working on programming problems everyday
                     on this website called Hackerrank, right now I'm on this thing called 30 Day of Code and it was so intense,
                      I just have to say both vectors and classes are just difficult ugh, and worse yet I'm doing it in C++ lol 
                      but it's for the best I guess. I've also watched this series called Mind Hunter OMG it was just mind blowing
                      , it was very intense though like wow. Also I'm going to see both Blade Runner soon and definitely want 
                      to see Thor Ragnarok. Let me not even get started on Bitcoin too lol, just have to say cryptocurrencies
                       are the future no matter what, some might say blockchain technology but close enough lol.

            <h2 id="p10">So I didn't post in a month, yeah I know I'm slacking but since I started working it definitely has been a roller coaster lol, 
            definitely has been eye opening	working somewhere though. I mean DO NOT get me wrong lol I have worked before at the dining commons and Penn State 
            but this is like a full job. I remember my first week of working at NGC when every time I got home I kid you not I would drop down on the couch 
            and just drop asleep. But overtime I'm getting accustomed to it you know and I'm learning a lot, it isn't hard-core programming but you know you 
            have to work with what you got. Also Spiderman Homecoming is coming out soon and I'm going to see it but I don't know how it's going to be but hopefully it's good.

It definitely helps to know that I'm starting to patch things up with special people around me and I know I have a lot more work to do with it but I know that it's possible and is definitely worth fighting for.
