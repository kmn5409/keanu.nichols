		<h1>Detective Conan</h1>
		<p>What I love about it: The fact that I have watched over 400 episodes of this show and am still not able to guess the murderer is absolutely the best thing about this show.</p>

		<h3>The Leader?</h3>
		<p>My suspicions about who the leader of the organization I know is definitely far from being
		true, the usual suspects is someone close to Conan but the craziest one I've heard if Professor
		Agasa but this could still be plausable.</p>
		
		<h3>Why not tell Ran?</h3>
		<p>I have to admit that I have my reserves about leaving Ran out of all that is going on, due to the fact that she herself is still being put in danger, however I understand that if Kudo does reveal the truth to her she will put herself in more danger to protect him. But I guess that just shows how much they both love each other.</p>
